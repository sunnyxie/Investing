<!--  This XML file stores the structure for the top menu bar.  The security_op_id attribute can be added 
      to any element (menu or submenu) to secure that element through AppSecure.  The value for the attribute 
      must be the OPERATION (not role) that is required to see the menu item.  Note that submenus for any 
      secured menu item will also be trimmed if their parent is removed.
